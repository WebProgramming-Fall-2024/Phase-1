### **Project Definition**

#### **Vision**  
The goal is to create an interactive game where users can take on the role of a designer to create questions for other users playing the game. This platform fosters learning and knowledge exchange, allowing users to earn points and enhance their profiles by creating appropriate questions and providing correct answers. It serves as an educational and entertaining tool to encourage active participation in learning.

### **Requirements**

#### **Users**  
The system will have two types of users: **designers** and **players**. Each groupâ€™s requirements are detailed separately. Both roles require registration and login.

#### **Designer Role**  
- Create multiple-choice questions (including the question text, options, correct answer, etc.)
- Create new categories
- Categorize questions into existing categories
- Set question difficulty levels
- Link related questions (either from the same designer or others)

#### **Player Role**  
- Answer questions from a chosen category
- Answer random questions
- Follow question designers
- Follow other players
- View leaderboard

### **Phase 1 â€“ Practical Section**

#### **Goals**  
In this phase, the focus is on designing and implementing the user interface of the project. The aim is to create static pages of the system using HTML and CSS. This includes designing the various pages, selecting colors, fonts, layouts, and more, which significantly impact user experience. Below are the descriptions and key elements of the required pages.

#### **Current Phase Description**  
- **Designerâ€™s Main Page:** This is shown after login and should provide access to category management and question management pages.
- **Category Management Page:** Allows viewing existing categories and creating new ones.
- **Question Management Page:** Similar to category management, this allows viewing and creating new questions.
- **Playerâ€™s Main Page:** Displayed after login, providing access to question management and the leaderboard.
- **Question Management Page (Player):** Allows starting new questions and viewing answered ones.
- **Leaderboard Page:** Displays the leaderboard for players.

### **Expected Outputs**

#### **Mandatory**
- Project architecture documentation that briefly outlines the system entities and provides a high-level view of the pages (using tools like wireframes to show the available pages and their connections).
- A maximum 5-minute video showcasing the output with explanations, uploaded with other required documentation.
- Login page.
- Two main pages for the designer and player roles, each including menus to other pages.
- Two question management pages for designers and players, with implemented requirements.
- Leaderboard page with the required features.
- Category management page for designers with the required features.

#### **Optional**
- Implement filters and categories in lists.
- Apply SEO principles, such as proper metadata and semantic tags.
- Add dark mode functionality.
- Ensure responsiveness (e.g., adapting appearance based on the device type, modifying menus, etc.).
- Enhance the visual appeal of pages (including proper color selection principles).

### **Notes**
- Project submission deadline is early November.
- For questions about this phase, use the hashtag #phase1 in the Telegram group.
- Create a maximum 5-minute video introducing the system (showing different pages, etc.).
- You are not expected to reinvent the wheel ðŸ™‚, so using popular CSS libraries is allowed. However, if you implement creative designs without CSS libraries, you can earn bonus points.
